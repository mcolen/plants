I have not been shaking consistently before today but I'll try to remember this week. I don't think I was shaking for nearly long enough anyway. I did some research which suggested I shake for [1-2 minutes](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/free-fiddle-leaf-fig-care-trick-36849089#:~:text=one%20to%20two%20minutes%20a%20day). This article also suggests to [remove the stake for shaking](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/free-fiddle-leaf-fig-care-trick-36849089#:~:text=Remove%20the%20support%20before%20you%20exercise%20your%20tree%2C%20then%20replace%20it%20after%20your%20session.). Thoughts?
